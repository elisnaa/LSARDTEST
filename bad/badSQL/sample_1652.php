# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _POST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: htmlentities_prm__<c>(ENT_COMPAT) ==> Filters:[Filtered(", &, <, >)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Filtered(", &, <, >)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_plain
- Sink: pg_query_prm__<$>(db)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes


# Exploit description

1. No enclosure and special chars are allowed -> SQL injection

<?php
# Init
$db = pg_pconnect("host=postgres-server port=5432 user=postgres password=postgres123 dbname=myDB");


# Sample
